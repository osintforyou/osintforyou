### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

My name is Almos, and I am an OSINT enthusiast and cyber security student, creating python scripts to support OSINT investigations.

I am currently working on a project, where the program can check if a website has any new updates since the last one, and if there is any new content, it sends an email with a screenshot.
